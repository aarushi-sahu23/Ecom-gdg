## **Features**
1. **Automated Damage Detection**:
   - Uses image comparison and classification models to detect damaged products and attribute faults to logistics or sellers.

2. **One-Click Claim Submission**:
   - Simplifies the claims process with pre-filled forms offering multiple claim options (full refund, partial refund, replacement).

3. **Smart Packaging Recommendations**:
   - AI-driven packaging suggestions based on product fragility, shipping conditions, and environmental factors.

4. **Claim Analytics Dashboard**:
   - Provides sellers with insights into claim trends and logistics performance.

5. **Customer Feedback Analysis**:
   - Natural Language Processing (NLP) analyzes customer reviews and historical data for recurring issues and claims support.

## **Technology Stack**

### **Frontend**
- **React** and **TailwindCSS**: For a simple, customizable and intuitive user interface.
- **Chart.js**: For visualizing analytics and performance trends.

### **Backend**
- **Flask Framework**: Lightweight architecture to integrate and serve AI models as an API.
- **MongoDB**: Handles structured claim data and analytics for quick retrieval.
- **TensorFlow** and **Scikit-Learn**: Runs locally for image recognition and NLP-based sentiment analysis.

### **AI Models**
1. **Image Comparison Model**: Detects differences between seller-provided and customer-provided images.
2. **Review Analysis Model**: Classifies text reviews into logistic or seller-related issues.
3. **Image Classification Model**: Identifies damage types in product images.

### **File Management**
- Temporarily stores uploaded files in organized local directories for processing.
- Deletes files post-prediction to maintain disk space and user privacy.
